# Assembly instructions

- Open the SANNAHED picture frame 
- Clean the cover and remove the protective cover
- Print onlydigits.png
- solder the 4 quarter circles by connecting output to input except at the 12 o' clock position.
- connect ESP8266 5V to 5V and GND to GND of the circle display and D4 to data In (DIN)
- glue the circle on top of the print
- cut the passepartout to fit to the circle diameter
- change the wooden square box inside the picture frame, such that the backside gets deep into the picture frame, bringing the clock forward. This gives ample space to put the ESP8266
